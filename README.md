# React + Node.js + Express app

In this app you can build a working calculator from base elements in whatever order you like with help of Drag&Drops mechanism

**Link to a deployed app: [https://calc-constructor.herokuapp.com](https://calc-constructor.herokuapp.com)**
<br>

There is 2 modes:

|**Mode**   |**Functionality**|
|:---------:|-----------------|
|Constructor| User can make use of Drag&Drop benefits in ordering components|
|Preview    | User is able to make calculations with built calculator|

## Functionality:
1) Drag blocks from sidebar to canvas
2) Reorder blocks *(place will be highlighted)*
3) Delete block from canvas with double click
4) Switch to other mode whenever you want

## Techologies:
- Frontend: Typescript, React + React, Material-UI, Eslint.
- Backend: Express, Node.js
- Drag&Drop: **dnd/kit** library

## TODO:

- Provide ability to make calculations with more than 2 numbers
- Correctly display big numbers with `e+24` notation
